# What's this?
tin-recorder is a standalone client which allows you to record tunein radios. You can record radios directly or schedule downloads for a later time.

# Prerequisites
* Node

# Getting started
* Clone this repository
* npm run build
* npm start (or npm run debug)  

# Readonly

This does not work anymore as tunein has changed and with there being security issues, I am putting this to readonly.
